# TCPTrafficAnalysis
A python program to analyze tcp traffic in a .cap file


To run the file you want to do:

 python TCPTrafficAnalysis.py sample-capture-file.cap 

(where the file is the file + path, I just have it in the same folder)

or alternatively if that doesn't work you can uncomment the PCAP_FILE line (in case of emergencies)
but it really should work

It will print out the output in the terminal
